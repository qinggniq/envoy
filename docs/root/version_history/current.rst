* http: replaced setting `envoy.reloadable_features.strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers` with settings
  `envoy.reloadable_features.require_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers`
  (require upstream 1xx or 204 responses to not have Transfer-Encoding or non-zero Content-Length headers) and
  `envoy.reloadable_features.send_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers`
  (do not send 1xx or 204 responses with these headers). Both are true by default.
